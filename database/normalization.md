# Normalization:
    basically normalization is a process to organize data in database and reduce and remove redundency or duplication data in table.

# why do we need noralization?

    normalization need for fixed insert anomaly, update anomaly and delete anomaly.

    insert anomaly is when  insert new data in table only for two column not for every columns then other columns is empty .
    update anomaly is when update data for one column but this data is in multiple row then update every row column for this data.
    delete anomaly is when delete row then somedata is deleted forever and not back again..which is need in future.

    also reduce or remove redundency data in table.

    so avoid these problems we need normalization.

with avobe example show how normalization organize data and reduce or remove redundency



# types of normalization
    normalization has many types like 1st form, 2nd form, 3rd form, bcnf, 4th form, 5th form etc.


# 1st normal form
    For 1st normal form,

    in a column multi values not allowed.
    column value must be domain specific.
    every column name must be unique.
    doesn't matter which order data is sorted.

# drawback of 1st normal form
    same data in multiple rows for multiple time
    difficult to update all instance or reperated data. so problem of update anomalise.
    insert partial data leads to null value and incomplete records. problem of insert anomalise.
    deleating a row may remove vital information unintentionaly. problem of delete anomaliise.



# 2nd normal form
    for 2nd normal form

    table should be in 1st normal form
    partialy dipendency not allowed, need to reduce patially dependency.


# what is partially dependency?
    for understand partially dependency first need to know about dependency or functional dependency.

    dependency or functional dependency:  suppose one table has three columns id, name , address and id is primary key... so in this table with id i can find specific row but with name or address i can't find specific row because name or address can be duplicate. so  here name and address depend on id . so this call dependency or functional dependency.


# Functional Dependency Table Example

| id  | name        | address             |
|-----|------------|--------------------|
| 1   | John Doe   | 123 Main St        |
| 2   | Alice Smith| 456 Park Ave       |
| 3   | Bob Brown  | 789 Elm St         |
| 4   | John Doe   | 123 Main St        |
| 5   | Alice Smith| 456 Park Ave       |

## Functional Dependencies:

| Functional Dependency        | Explanation                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **id → name, address**        | `id` uniquely determines both `name` and `address`.       |
| **name → address (Invalid)**  | Not valid, same name can have multiple addresses.         |
| **(name, address) → id**      | Together `name` and `address` can determine `id`.          |

## Explanation:

- `id` is the **Primary Key**, so:




partially dependency: suppose on table has student_id, name, address, course_id, course_name, credit, grade. and student_id is primary key.  also this table has composite key. partial dependency occurs using composite key..when any row identify using multiple columns then use composite key. this table composite key
is student_id and course_id. now check partial dependency in this table. non key columns course_name, credit depends on course_id  not depends on student_id...also non key columns name, address depends on student_id not course_id..so when use composite key as student_id and course_id then course_name, credit depends on composite key also name, address depends on composite key..so its called partial dependency.



# Partial Dependency Table Example

| student_id | name        | address        | course_id | course_name      | credit | grade |
|-----------:|:------------|:--------------|:---------:|:-----------------|:------:|:-----:|
| 1          | John Doe    | 123 Main St   | CSE101    | Computer Science |   3    |  A    |
| 1          | John Doe    | 123 Main St   | MTH101    | Mathematics      |   4    |  B    |
| 2          | Alice Smith | 456 Park Ave  | CSE101    | Computer Science |   3    |  B+   |
| 2          | Alice Smith | 456 Park Ave  | PHY101    | Physics          |   3    |  A-   |
| 3          | Bob Brown   | 789 Elm St    | MTH101    | Mathematics      |   4    |  A    |

## Functional Dependencies:

| Dependency                                         | Type                 | Explanation                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **(student_id, course_id) → grade**                | Full Dependency      | Grade depends on both `student_id` & `course_id`.   |
| **student_id → name, address**                     | Partial Dependency   | `name` & `address` depend only on `student_id`.     |
| **course_id → course_name, credit**                | Partial Dependency   | `course_name` & `credit` depend only on `course_id`.|

---

## Why Partial Dependency?

- The **composite primary key** is `(student_id, course_id)`.
- Attributes like `name`, `address`, `course_name`, `credit` depend **only on part of the key**, not the full key.
- This violates **2NF (Second Normal Form)**.

---

## Solution:

To remove partial dependency:

1. Split the table:
    - **Student Table:** `student_id, name, address`
    - **Course Table:** `course_id, course_name, credit`
    - **Enrollment Table:** `student_id, course_id, grade`

## 🎯 Explanation:
- **Student Table:** Stores student-specific data (no redundancy).
- **Course Table:** Stores course-specific data (no redundancy).
- **Enrollment Table:** Manages the relationship between students & courses, along with the `grade`.

# 3rd Normal Form
    table should be 2nd normal form
    transitve dependency not allowed


    Transitive dependency:  In a table if any non key column depend on another non key columns then it's called transitive dependency.



## ❌ Original Table (2NF with Transitive Dependency)

| course_id | course_name        | credit | teacher_id | teacher_name |

| ENG101   | English Literature |   2    | T04       | Sarah Green  |

### 🔍 Issue:
- **Transitive Dependency:**
  - `course_id → teacher_id → teacher_name`
- Teacher name depends on `teacher_id`, not directly on `course_id`.

# Boyce-Codd normal form
    table must be in 3rd normal form
    remove key column dependency on non key column
    remove insert,update and delete anomaly

## 🔥 Table Structure:

| student_name | course_name        | instructor_name |
|:-----------:|:-------------------|:---------------:|
| Alice       | Computer Science   | John Doe        |
| Bob         | Mathematics        | Alice Smith     |

| David       | Computer Science   | John Doe        |
| Emma        | Mathematics        | Alice Smith     |

---

## 🎯 **Primary Key:**
- **(student_name, course_name)** → Composite Primary Key

---

## 🔍 **Dependency:**

- **Functional Dependency:**  
  `course_name → instructor_name`

---

## 🚨 **Problem:**

- **`course_name` is NOT a candidate key.**
- **Instructor depends on `course_name` alone (non-prime attribute), violating BCNF!**
- **Cource name depends on instructor_name column.here course_name is primary key. so when key column depends on non key column then its violating BCNF!**

---

## ⚠️ **Anomalies Present:**

### 1. **Insert Anomaly:**
- Cannot insert a new course & instructor without having at least one student enrolled.
  
  _Example:_  
  Can't add: course_name = "Chemistry", instructor_name = "Dr. Smith"   without a student!



---

### 2. **Update Anomaly:**
- Instructor's name appears multiple times.
- Updating instructor for a course → **must update all rows**.

_Risk:_ Forgetting some rows → **data inconsistency**.

---

### 3. **Delete Anomaly:**
- Deleting all students enrolled in a course → **lose instructor info**.

_Example:_  
If all students drop "Mathematics", **lose who teaches it!**

---

## 🛠️ **Solution (BCNF Decomposition):**

### 📄 **Student Enrollment Table:**

## ✅ **Benefits After BCNF:**

- No redundancy.
- No anomalies.
- Clean separation of **student-course** and **course-instructor** data.

# 📘 4th Normal Form (4NF) in Database Normalization

## 🧠 What is 4NF?

4th Normal Form is a level of database normalization that addresses **multivalued dependencies**.  
A relation is in **4NF** if:

1. It is in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**.
2. It has **no multivalued dependencies** (MVDs).

---

## 🧪 Example Table (Violating 4NF)

| student_id | skill         | hobby         |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| S01        | Python        | Chess         |
| S01        | Java          | Chess         |
| S01        | Python        | Painting      |
| S01        | Java          | Painting      |

---

### 🎯 Issue:
- A student can have **multiple skills** and **multiple hobbies** independently.
- This creates **multivalued dependencies**:
  - `student_id →→ skill`
  - `student_id →→ hobby`
- Every combination of skill and hobby is stored — **causing redundancy**.

---

## ⚠️ Anomalies in 4NF Violation:

### 🔁 **Insert Anomaly:**
- Cannot add a new skill or hobby independently.
- Example: Adding `"C++"` as a skill for `S01` requires pairing it with **all hobbies**.

### 🛑 **Delete Anomaly:**
- Deleting a skill-hobby pair may result in loss of unrelated information.
- Example: Deleting `(Python, Chess)` may accidentally remove knowledge of `"Python"` if it's the last occurrence.

### ✏️ **Update Anomaly:**
- If a student improves a skill (e.g., renaming `"Java"` to `"Java SE"`), this change must be updated in **every row where that skill is paired with a hobby**.
- **Risk:** Missing any row leads to **inconsistent data**.

---

## ✅ Decomposition into 4NF

|:----------:|:---------:|
| S01        | Chess     |
| S01        | Painting  |

## ✔️ Benefits of 4NF

- Eliminates **multivalued dependencies**
- Prevents **insert, update, and delete anomalies**
- Reduces **redundancy**
- Improves **data consistency**

# 📗 5th Normal Form (5NF) – Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)

## 🧠 What is 5NF?

A relation is in **5th Normal Form (5NF)** or **Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)** when:

1. It is already in **4NF**.
2. It cannot be **further decomposed** into two or more **smaller relations** without **loss of data** when joined back.

5NF deals with **join dependencies** and ensures **lossless join decomposition**.

---

## 🧪 Example: Table Violating 5NF

Let’s say a company stores relationships between **Consultants**, **Projects**, and **Technologies** used.

| consultant | project     | technology   |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Alice      | Banking App | Java         |
| Alice      | Banking App | Python       |
| Alice      | HR System   | Java         |
| Bob        | Banking App | Java         |

---

### 🎯 Problem:
The combinations are **not truly independent**. For instance, not all combinations of `consultant-project-technology` may be valid — only specific ones are.

- You **can't split this** into just `consultant-project`, `consultant-technology`, and `project-technology` and expect to reconstruct it exactly.
- This is a **join dependency** problem → handled in **5NF**.

---

## ⚠️ Anomalies in 5NF Violation

### 🛑 Insert Anomaly:
- You cannot add that **Alice uses Python** on **HR System** without also inserting irrelevant or invalid combinations.

### ✏️ Update Anomaly:
- Updating a consultant’s skill or project may require modifying **many rows** with risk of inconsistency.

### ❌ Delete Anomaly:
- Removing one row might cause **loss of valid relationships** among other attributes.

---
